                <p> I want to be...</p>
                <p>One of the most well equipped IT professionals In New Jersey.
                </p>
                <p> It seems like an odd goal, but I have been working at it for
                    sometime and Ihave fait in what i'm trying to accomplish.
                </p>
                <p>I have spent a lot of time learning about windows operating
                    systems, networking as well as informatics as it relates to
                    healthcare. I honestly see myself making great things happen
                    within the industry.</p>
                <p> To be totally honest i am enjoying this class. I feel as if
                    the knowledge i'm gaining here is definitely going to be
                    very useful as time goes on.</p>
                <p>Besides work school and my ambitions...</p>
                <p> I love spending time with my friends,family and a good
                    Show to binge over the weekend. I never watch TV
                    episodically. That is a thing of the past.</p>
                <p>Lastly...</p>
                <p> I can't wait to see what this course has in store for us.
                </p>
                <p> Thanks for reading! </p>
