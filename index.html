                    <p> I want to be...</p>
                    <p>One of the most well equipped IT professionals In New
                        Jersey.
                    </p>
                    <p> It seems like an odd goal, but I have been working at it
                        for
                        sometime and Ihave faith in what i'm trying to
                        accomplish.
                    </p>
                    <p>I have spent a lot of time learning about windows
                        operating
                        systems, networking as well as informatics as it relates
                        to
                        healthcare. I honestly see myself making great things
                        happen
                        within the industry.</p>
                    <p> To be totally honest i am enjoying this class. I feel as
                        if
                        the knowledge i'm gaining here is definitely going to be
                        very useful as time goes on.</p>
                    <p>Besides work school and my ambitions...</p>
                    <p> I love spending time with my friends,family and a good
                        Show to binge over the weekend. I never watch TV
                        episodically. That is a thing of the past.</p>
                    <p>Lastly...</p>
                    <p> I can't wait to see what this course has in store for
                        us.
                    </p>
                    <p> Thanks for reading! </p>
